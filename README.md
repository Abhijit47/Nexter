# Nexter
This is the landing page of a fictional company called "Nexter," which sells luxury homes across the world.
I built this project specifically just for the goal of this project, which is basically to use as many grids here as possible. 
So here are not these fancy effects going on like I had in the other project, but instead, I really focused on the CSS grid here. 
So the entire layout of the page is of course a CSS grid, and then I also used grids in many smaller components.
Like, for example, here on this sidebar, we have a CSS grid, and then this entire header works as a grid. 
And of course, this entire thing is completely responsive.
